== New README ==
I've added fcshbuild which takes an as file entry point as an argument along with a config xml file.
It will automatically startup an fcsh server in the background if it doesn't exist.

Setup a build script like "fcshbuild Main.as config.xml" for fast compilation.
To kill the server run "fcshkill".

== Original README ==
this is a collection of bash scripts that wraps fcsh : Flex Compiler SHell
so that you can compile and run .as or .mxml files from vim.
tested only on GNU/Linux.

requirements:
- fcsh ( http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flex_Compiler_Shell )
- bash

1) tar xvjf fcshtools.tar.bz2

2) cd fcshtools

3) cp *.sh <wherever you want>
it's recommended to put  the files to $HOME/bin.

4) set FCSH_VIM_ROOT = $<wherever you want>
if you don't set this environment variable, it'll look at $HOME/bin.

5) edit ~/.vimrc
if you put the files to $HOME/bin, then add these:
    autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.mxml,*.as :nmap <C-B> :!bash ~/bin/fcshcmp.sh %:p
    autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.mxml,*.as :nmap <C-A> :!bash ~/bin/fcshcmp.sh %:p run

<C-B> will just compile the current file being edited.
<C-A> will compile and run the .swf on flashplayer.

6) bash $FCSH_VIM_ROOT/fcshserv.sh
this runs fcsh and creates a named pipe so fcshcmp.sh can send messages to.
Ctrl+C quits the server.

7) vim hello.as

8) <C-B> or <C-A>
